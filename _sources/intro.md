# Welcome

Welcome to the **Optimization Techniques for Bid Data Analysis (OTBD)** course, which is part of the Signal Processing and machine learning for big data track of the [Master of Science in Signal Theory and Communications](https://ssr.upm.es/en/mutsc/). 

This course delves into the fundamental concepts and theoretical underpinnings of convex optimization, offering a comprehensive set of algorithms designed to address a wide range of standard optimization challenges in the field of Machine Learning. Additionally, the course explores algorithm variations tailored for local processing within distributed environments, particularly suitable for handling large-scale data scenarios.
